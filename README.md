# [THIS REPO IS A FORK. ORIGINAL: https://github.com/brndd/dvorakfi](https://github.com/brndd/dvorakfi)

## Key differences to the original repo
1. This repo contains mac and windows layouts
2. Linux layout is not maintained
3. Special keys are more or less where they are in standard finnish qwerty keyboard
4. b and j are swapped because j is so much often used in finnish
5. Keys function similarly to standard qwerty. ie. in finnish qwerty <>| come from single key next to left shift. This key is now in different place but is still the same key. ie. chars <>| are not scattered all around the layout.
